My name is Drew Owen. I originally began working in MEMS and microfluidics but for the past several years I have been working as a data scientist. 

This is a collection of personal projects and spans a pretty wide range of interests, from biology to roleplaying games. 

Some of these repos are working code, some are more like blog posts that use data.
